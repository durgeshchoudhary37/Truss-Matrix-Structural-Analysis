# Truss-Matrix-Structural-Analysis

Open the folder in matlab and run the main.m file to run the code.

• Finite element analysis of space trusses and structural analysis of frames using matlab.
• Determination of unknown displacements and forces in a structure subjected to known values.
• Visual representation of the undeformed and deformed structures (3D plot), bending moment and shear force diagrams.
